Hi! I like shorts! They're comfy and easy to wear!

## About

I mostly code in **python and C++** and I started my venture of coding around **2019** because I wanted to know how games actually worked behind the scenes. Which this then brought me from using game engines to using game frameworks to making my own game engines and game frameworks.

What I really like to program is **automation, bots, fixes to my minor inconveniences, games and game engines** so those are what will mostly be put on here.

**I also have an Itch.io account where I post some things too (mainly game jam games): https://bjl156.itch.io/**
