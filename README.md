Hi! I like shorts! They're comfy and easy to wear!

## About

I am a highschooler that mostly codes in **python and C++** and I started my venture of coding off in around **2019** because I wanted to know how games actually worked behind the scenes. Which this then brought me from using game engines to using game frameworks to making my own game engines and game frameworks.

What I really like to program is **automation, bots, games and game engines** so those are what will mostly be put on here.
