My Favorite Projects:

  - An open-source small graphics engine with a UI which I developed during school for some time.
- [AWESOME 3D SPINNING CUBE](https://github.com/BJL156/CodeHS-3D-Spinning-Cube)
  - A software renderer that prints out a colored 3D render of a spinning cube. I wrote this entirely during school on my school's website, CodeHS, which they use for programming.
